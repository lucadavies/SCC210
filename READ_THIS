If you want to start working on a specific section of the game,
e.g collision, create a new branch and work on it seperately to the master, 
and then once it's bug free you can merge with the master branch, that way we'll
always have a bug free version of the game.

To compile and run what we have so far:
	
	javac -cp jsfml.jar;. *.java
	java -cp jsfml.jar;. Alienation
