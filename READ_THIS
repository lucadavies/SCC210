If you want to start working on a specific section of the game,
e.g collision, create a new branch and work on it seperately to the master, 
and then once it's bug free you can merge with the master branch, that way we'll
always have a bug free version of the game.

To compile and run what we have so far:

	Using cmd:

	javac -cp jsfml.jar;. Alienation.java
	java -cp jsfml.jar;. Alienation

	Using PowerShell or bash
	javac -cp '.;./jsfml.jar' Alienation.java
    java -cp '.;./jsfml.jar' Alienation
